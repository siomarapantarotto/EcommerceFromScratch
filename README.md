## General info
"EcommerceFromScratch" is a basic JAVA project course. This ecommerce project course was created to teach basic JAVA with no framework usage.
The purpose is to give students an idea on how to create an ecommerce from scratch.
Instead of a course with different lessons (1, 2, 3 etc) , each one teaching a certain thing, I decided to put together all separated knowledge in this project.
This way students can finish the course and start coding projects, not only repeat the lessons.
The course does not provide a complete ecommerce project but every time I got a free time I try to make it better.
Contributions are more than welcome. Please, feel free to contact me if you are willing to help.

More detailed documentation can be found directly on the code.


## Technologies
The project is created with:
* NetBeans IDE 8.1
* Java


## Setup
To run this project, just download the project directory to your "NetBeansProjects" folder and run it.
