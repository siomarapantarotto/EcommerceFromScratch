## General info
"EcommerceFromScratch" is a basic JAVA PROJECT COURSE that runs on console and provides students orientation on how to structure a project within an IDE.
This ecommerce project course was created in 2016 to teach basic JAVA with no framework usage.
The purpose is to give students an idea on how to create an ecommerce from scratch.
Instead of a course with different lessons (1, 2, 3 etc) , each one teaching a certain thing, I decided to put together all separated knowledge in this project.
This way students can finish the course and start coding projects, not only repeat the lessons.
The course does not provide a complete ecommerce system but every time I got a free time I try to make it better.

More detailed documentation can be found directly on the code.


## Technologies
The project is created with:
* NetBeans IDE 8.1
* Java


## Setup
To run this project, just download the project directory to your "NetBeansProjects" folder and run it.
