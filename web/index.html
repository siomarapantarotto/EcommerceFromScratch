            <h1>E-COMMERCE FROM SCRATCH</h1>
            <h2>A simple basic JAVA console project.</h2>
            <p>This ecommerce project is actually a course, created to teach basic JAVA with no framework usage.</p>
            <p>The purpose is to give students an idea on how to create an ecommerce (or any other project) from scratch.</p>  
            <p>Instead of a course with diferent lessons (1, 2, 3 etc) , each one teaching a certain thing, I decided to put together all separated knowledge in a project.</p>
            <p>This way students can finish the course and start coding projects, not only repeat the lessons.</p>
            <p>The course does not provide a complete ecommerce project but everytime I got a free time I try to make it better.</p>
            <p>Contributions are more than welcome. Please, feel free to contact me if you are willing to help.</p>
            <p>Thanks!</p>
